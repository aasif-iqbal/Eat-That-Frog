## REST API
A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way for software applications to communicate with each other over the internet using a standardized set of rules. It allows one program to ask another program for data or to send it data, typically in a simple, human-readable format like JSON or XML.

Here's a breakdown:

### Key Concepts
1. **Resources:** 
   - Everything is treated as a resource (e.g., users, products, orders).
   - Each resource is identified by a unique URL (e.g., `https://example.com/users`).

2. **HTTP Methods:**
   REST uses standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources:
   - `GET`: Retrieve data (e.g., "Give me the list of users").
   - `POST`: Create new data (e.g., "Add a new user").
   - `PUT`: Update existing data (e.g., "Update the information for user 123").
   - `DELETE`: Remove data (e.g., "Delete user 123").

3. **Stateless:**
   - Each request from a client to the server is independent and contains all the information needed to process it.
   - The server doesn't remember previous interactions (no session).

4. **Data Formats:**
   - Data is usually exchanged in **JSON** (e.g., `{"id": 1, "name": "John"}`) or **XML** formats.

5. **Endpoints:**
   - These are specific URLs where resources are accessible. For example:
     - `GET /users`: Get all users.
     - `GET /users/1`: Get a specific user with ID 1.
     - `POST /users`: Add a new user.

6. **Response Codes:**
   - REST APIs return HTTP status codes to indicate the result of a request:
     - `200`: Success.
     - `201`: Resource created.
     - `404`: Resource not found.
     - `500`: Server error.

### Example:
If you're shopping online and use a REST API to manage your cart:
- **Add a product to your cart:** `POST /cart` with details about the product.
- **View your cart:** `GET /cart`.
- **Update quantity:** `PUT /cart/123` to change the quantity of the product with ID 123.
- **Remove a product:** `DELETE /cart/123`.

**Why REST APIs?**
- They are simple, standardized, and work with most programming languages.
- They allow apps and services to integrate seamlessly.
