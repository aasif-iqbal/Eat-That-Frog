**Reverse routing** in Laravel refers to the process of **generating URLs** to named routes using route names rather than hardcoding the URL paths.

---

### âœ… Why Itâ€™s Useful

* **DRY principle**: Avoids repeating hardcoded URLs throughout your app.
* **Safe refactoring**: If you change a routeâ€™s path, Laravel updates all generated URLs automatically.
* **Dynamic route generation**: Pass route parameters easily.

---

### ðŸ”§ Example

#### 1. **Define a Named Route**

```php
Route::get('/posts/{id}', [PostController::class, 'show'])->name('posts.show');
```

#### 2. **Use Reverse Routing**

```php
$url = route('posts.show', ['id' => 42]);
```

#### âœ… Output:

```
/posts/42
```

### ðŸ§  Where You Can Use It

* In Controllers: `return redirect()->route('posts.show', $id);`
* In Blade views: `<a href="{{ route('posts.show', $post->id) }}">View</a>`
* In tests and middleware too
