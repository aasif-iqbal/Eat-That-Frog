## What is Project Memory and default memory for nodejs

### **Project Memory**
Project memory refers to the amount of system memory (RAM) allocated for running a specific project or application. In the context of Node.js, it relates to how much memory your Node.js application can utilize during its execution. This includes memory for variables, functions, objects, and other runtime data.

### **Default Memory in Node.js**
Node.js uses **V8**, the JavaScript engine, to manage memory. By default, the V8 engine allocates a fixed amount of memory for Node.js applications:

1. **Default Memory Limit**:
   - **64-bit systems**: ~2 GB for the heap (used for objects, arrays, etc.) and ~1 GB for additional memory like buffers and the stack.
   - **32-bit systems**: ~1 GB for the heap.

2. **Heap Memory**:
   - The heap is where JavaScript objects and variables are stored.
   - Default limit: 2 GB (64-bit systems).

3. **Non-Heap Memory**:
   - This includes memory used for native bindings, C++ objects, and other system-related tasks.

### **Customizing Node.js Memory**
You can increase the memory limit if your application requires more than the default allocation. This is especially useful for memory-intensive applications such as large-scale data processing or handling large files.

#### **How to Increase Memory**:
Use the `--max-old-space-size` flag to allocate more memory for the Node.js process. The value is specified in megabytes (MB).

Example:
```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 app.js
```
- The above command sets the maximum heap size to 4 GB.

#### **Check Current Memory Usage**:
Use Node.js' `process.memoryUsage()` to view memory usage statistics:
```javascript
console.log(process.memoryUsage());
```

Output example:
```json
{
  rss: 20000000,
  heapTotal: 5000000,
  heapUsed: 3000000,
  external: 1000000
}
```
- **rss**: Resident Set Size (total memory used by the process, including heap and stack).
- **heapTotal**: Total allocated heap memory.
- **heapUsed**: Memory currently used on the heap.
- **external**: Memory used by C++ objects and external libraries.

### **Factors Affecting Memory Usage**
1. **Code Inefficiency**:
   - Poorly optimized code can lead to excessive memory usage.
2. **Large Data Sets**:
   - Processing large data sets in memory.
3. **Memory Leaks**:
   - Objects not properly de-referenced can cause memory to be retained unnecessarily.
