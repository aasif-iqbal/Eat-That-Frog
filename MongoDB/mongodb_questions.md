Here are some scenario-based MongoDB questions to help you deepen your understanding:

---

### 1. **Duplicate Record Prevention**
**Scenario**: You are building a user registration system where each user must have a unique email. How would you ensure that no two users can register with the same email in MongoDB?

---

### 2. **Find Overlapping Time Intervals**
**Scenario**: In a booking application, users can book time slots. Each booking has a `startTime` and `endTime`. How would you query MongoDB to find bookings that overlap with a given time range?

---

### 3. **Soft Delete Implementation**
**Scenario**: You are asked to implement a "soft delete" functionality where records are not removed from the database but are marked as deleted with a `deletedAt` field. How would you ensure queries only fetch non-deleted records by default?

---

### 4. **Paginated Search**
**Scenario**: You have a collection of articles, and you need to implement a search functionality with pagination. The articles should be sorted by `createdAt` in descending order, and each page should show 10 results. How would you structure the query?

---

### 5. **Many-to-Many Relationship**
**Scenario**: You are designing a blogging platform where articles can have multiple tags, and each tag can belong to multiple articles. How would you structure the schema and query articles by a specific tag?

---

### 6. **Top N Records**
**Scenario**: Your e-commerce application requires you to fetch the top 5 products based on their `sales` field. How would you achieve this using MongoDB?

---

### 7. **Aggregation for Reports**
**Scenario**: You are tasked with generating a sales report for an online store. The report should group sales data by month and calculate the total sales amount for each month. How would you write the aggregation query?

---

### 8. **Find Missing Records**
**Scenario**: You have two collections: `students` and `results`. Each student should have a result. How would you query MongoDB to find students without a corresponding result?

---

### 9. **Update Nested Field**
**Scenario**: In a document that stores user profile information, the address is a nested field:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "address": {
    "city": "Mumbai",
    "pin": "400001"
  }
}
```
How would you update only the `pin` field of the address without affecting other fields?

---

### 10. **Handling Large Datasets**
**Scenario**: Your collection has millions of documents, and a query is taking too long. What are some MongoDB features or techniques you can use to optimize the query performance?

---

### 11. **Conditional Updates**
**Scenario**: You need to update the `status` field of all orders to `"completed"` but only if their `deliveredAt` field is not null. How would you write this update query?

---

### 12. **Expire Data Automatically**
**Scenario**: In a temporary data storage system, you need documents to be deleted automatically after 7 days. How would you achieve this in MongoDB?

---

### 13. **Text Search with Filters**
**Scenario**: You are building a product search feature. Users can search for products using keywords, and you need to allow filtering by `category` and `price`. How would you write the query to combine text search with filters?

---

### 14. **Data Migration**
**Scenario**: A field in your collection needs to be renamed. How would you efficiently rename the field for all documents without downtime?

---

### 15. **Transaction Management**
**Scenario**: You need to implement a transactional operation where money is transferred from one user to another. Both updates (deduction and addition) must succeed, or neither should be applied. How would you implement this in MongoDB?
